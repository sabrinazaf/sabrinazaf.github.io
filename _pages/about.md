Bienvenue! I'm Sabrina Zafar, a quantitative research analyst, Carnegie Mellon Alumna (Statistics+ML'22), and amateur baker. This personal website is dedicated to highlighting  my CV, projects, and various topics I have gone down the rabbit hole on. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in learning more about my work or simply want to say hello!
