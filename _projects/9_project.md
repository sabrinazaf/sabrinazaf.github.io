I have been tutoring students of all ages in Mathematics and English for over 6 years as an independent tutor and through major test prep companies such as Chegg and Kumon. As a 99th percentile scorer on the SAT, ACT, and GMAT, I have guided dozens of students in achieving their target scores, improving their grades, and gaining admission into their top choices for college. Furthermore, I offer tutoring in elementary school, middle school, and high school mathematics. If your child is interested in cracking 1500/34 on the SAT/ACT or improving their mathematics ability, I can help! Reach me at sabrinaz@alumni.cmu.edu for details and referrals. Note: families who demonstrate financial hardship are eligible to receive no-cost tutoring.
