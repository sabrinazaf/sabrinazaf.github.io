I have been tutoring students of all ages in Mathematics and English for over 6 years as an independent tutor and through major test prep companies such as Chegg and Kumon. As a 99th percentile scorer on the SAT, ACT, and GMAT, I have guided dozens of students in achieving their target scores, improving their grades, and gaining admission into their top choices for college. Coming from a low-income background myself, I understand the challenges that many bright students face in accessing high-quality education. I am passionate about leveling the playing field by providing no-cost tutoring to motivated students who may not have the resources to afford expensive test prep. If you know of anyone who qualifies and is eager to improve their mathematics skills or SAT/ACT scores, I would love to help! Reach me at sabrinaz@alumni.cmu.edu for details and referrals.
